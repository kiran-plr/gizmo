                                        iPhone trade-in programs are generally carrier-specific and come with more limitations. With trade-in programs, you can only trade in your phone during certain time periods (i.e. every two years). Additionally, many trade-in programs do not buy old and broken iPhones. At Gizmogul, we buy it all! We buy phones in any condition from any provider. You can get cash for your iPhone without having to lock into a contract with a carrier.

                                        How does it work? Every item sent to us is evaluated by our technical staff, by hand, based on the information that you provided. If our evaluation does not match up with the one you completed online, the offer may decrease or increase accordingly. Revised Offers? If your offer changes for any reason, you will receive an adjustment email on the day of inspection with the new value and an explanation of any changes to your offer. If you disagree with our revised offer, we will gladly return your item to you free of charge. How to avoid a Revised Offer? The best way to prevent an offer drop is by providing as accurate an initial assessment as possible. If you need assistance determining the condition of your device(s), please see the condition descriptions above. It is also very common for customers to select the wrong model on our website. If you are not sure the exact model you have please contact us and ask with your device's serial number and ask for assistance before creating a transaction.
