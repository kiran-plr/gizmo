                    <p>Gizmogul is a leading mobile asset recovery company. Founded in 2015 in San Francisco, Gizmogul
                        is fueled by a world-class team, a broad distribution network and marketplace that allows users
                        to painlessly sell and purchase devices wholesale. At Gizmogul, we recognize that mobile
                        recycling should be simplified yet personalized. We strive to provide a straightforward
                        experience to our vendors and individual consumers.</p>
                    <h3>A CULTURE THAT CELEBRATES PHILANTHROPY</h3>
                    <p>At Gizmogul we pay people generously for devices while making a positive impact on the community.
                        Currently, for each transaction, we donate money to help build schools and fund valuable
                        afterschool programs domestically and abroad. Our charitable partner BuildOn has built more than
                        600 schools worldwide.</p>
                    <h3>WE ENSURE YOUR DEVICE ENDS UP IN THE RIGHT HANDS</h3>
                    <p>We don’t just know how to sell devices; we’ve built long-term relationships with trustworthy
                        vendors worldwide. This is how we ensure your devices won’t be discarded or shipped overseas to
                        hazardous dumpsites where environmental regulations are less strict. At Gizmogul we work
                        tirelessly to ensure your device ends up in good hands and are only put to good use.</p>
