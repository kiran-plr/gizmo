                    <p class="do-good-disc">Gizmogul has partnered with the renowned philanthropy BuildOn, whose sole
                        mission is to build
                        schools in developing nations across the globe. To date, BuildOn has built over 600 schools
                        worldwide and they break ground every two days on a new one. When you sell your device to
                        Gizmogul, $1 will be donated from Gizmogul’s profits, to a fund dedicated to building a specific
                        school.</p>
                    <h3 class="do-good-big-title">It only costs $30,000
                        to build a school</h3>
                    <p class="do-good-disc">It only costs $30k to build a school which means your dollar actually makes
                        a big dent. Can you believe that? To build an entire school in a community of kids who
                        desperately need it. Gizmogul will keep you in the loop throughout every phase of construction
                        with emails and video, so you can see first hand where your dollar went. It’s a pretty cool club
                        to be part of.</p>

                    <h5 class="mini-bold-title">So what do you have to do to be part of this program?</h5>
                    <p class="do-good-disc">Nothing. Just sell your device to us for the best price and Gizmogul will
                        donate $1 of their own profits on your behalf.</p>
                    <h5 class="mini-bold-title">Can you donate items directly to the cause?</h5>
                    <p class="do-good-disc">You better believe it. If you have a bunch of electronics or even a couple
                        old cell phones that you're looking to recycle responsibly, simply package them up and ship them
                        to:</p>
